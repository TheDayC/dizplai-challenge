# Dizplai Challenge
The programming challenge for Dizplai.

## Quick Start

Before running any of the following commands it's recommended that you have [Volta](https://docs.volta.sh/guide/getting-started) installed to manage your Node versions per application and for you to run `npm install` before any other NPM script. To run this application in a containerised format run the docker command:

```bash
npm run docker
```

## Development

Please refer to the application READMEs for the [UI](./ui/README.md) and [API](./api/README.md) to boot these applications in development mode. Both applications have hot reload and some linting / code formatting protection on staged files.
